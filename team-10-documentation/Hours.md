## Overview
| Name           | Stuff                    | Estimated hrs | Actual hrs |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Jay Patel      | CSS UI + testing         | 2             |            |
| Arnav Jain     | documentation + comments | 1             | .75        |
| Brett Balquist | Adding Audio             | 2             | 1.5        |
| Tej Gumaste    | Documentation            |               |            |
| Daniel Neugent | AI engine                | 1.5           | 1.5        |

Note: All people had an extra 1 hour due to weekly meetings

## Estimates
Jay's estimate: Finniky nature of CSS and difficulty with UI along with working on someone else's project which may or may not work leads to an estimation of 2 hrs. This is an overestimation assuming something doesn't work
Arnav's estimation: Documentation took 1 hour last time so same estimation this time
Brett's estimation: Finding or making audio can have its own challenges, coupled with the fact that it is integrating to an unfamiliar codebase leads to an estimation of 2 hours
Tej's estimation: 
Daniel's estimation: Creating the AI for it seems challenging, but the involves starting from scratch. This leads to an estimation of 1.5hrs

## Actual
### 09/27
Daniel 09/27: Daniel spent 1.5 hours making the AI logic. The estimation was spot on as working from an empty file made everything a bit easier

### 09/29
Brett 09/29: Spent 1.5hrs writing getting the audio, integrating it, and integrating the AI. Getting the audio was easier than expected but reading other people's code was still a bit of a challenge. 
Arnav 09/29: Spent 45m writing documentation and comments. His familiarity with the documentation lead to it being a bit faster than expected.
