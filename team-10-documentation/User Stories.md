# Product backlog
- As a player I’d like to have a timer that shows how long it’s taking me to complete the game 
- As a player I’d like the game to look more aesthetically pleasing so I want to play more. 
- As a player I’d like to have some sort of AI that could assist me and possibly take turns with me so that I don’t have to complete the game alone 
- As a user I want to be able to have a hint system revealing a safe cell with limited clues  
- As a player I want to have sound effects and animations for uncovering mines. 
- As a player I want to be able to adjust difficulty level to Souls level difficulty
